# Copy-and-Paste-Exploit
Some terminals have a venerability so if you paste something with a \\n at the end it will run it, this website will create a script for you that will automatically hide its tracks (the user will not be able to see what was really ran). This could be used if you have a website that tells the user to run something in the terminal and when they copy the text it will replace it with this (and a \\n at the end).
